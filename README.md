# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using Python. It uses **Matplotlib** to visualize sorting algorithms in action, animating the process of sorting random integers step by step.

## Features
- Visualizes the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Randomly generates a list of integers for sorting.
- Displays the number of operations (iterations) performed during the sorting process.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

You can install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
